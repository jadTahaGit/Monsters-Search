# Story of React

- Back then We needed as devs to deal with Different Browsers.
- Jquery came & made interacting with dif. Browsers easy & unified.
- BackBones.js Libraries came out to organize Huge # of JS Files
- It got easier & easier to work with DOM -> SPA & AJAX came out so we started caring less about HTML & more about JS. Less requests to the server (Desktop APP Feeling "no refresh").
- 2010 AngularJS created by Google. Concept was these huge containers (controllers directives filters...) MVC made Angular Popular. But Things are getting Complex Data was Flowing Everywhere (it was getting harder to solve the bugs).
- FB employes has faced a lot of problems --> 2013 React, which was a new Way(Architecture) which is a more better way than Angular. (2014 wanted then to rewrite the whole Library)
